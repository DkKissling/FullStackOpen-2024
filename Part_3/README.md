# Fullstack Phonebook Application

This repository contains a fullstack application for managing a phonebook, including both backend and frontend deployed online.

## Description

This project implements a phonebook where users can add, delete, and view contacts. The backend provides a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express to manage contact data stored in a MongoDB database. The frontend interacts with this API to provide an intuitive user interface.

## Online Deployment

The backend is deployed at [https://phonebook-backend-fragrant-paper-2482.fly.dev/](https://phonebook-backend-fragrant-paper-2482.fly.dev/). The entire application is accessible online for testing all functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas for database storage.
- **Frontend**: React for the user interface.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Fly.io for backend deployment online.

## Completed Exercises

- Initial setup of Node.js and Express server.
